- **Synchronization**: Keep environments synchronized with production

### TD-021: Monitoring and Observability Stack
**Date**: 2024-12-01 | **Status**: Accepted | **Review Date**: 2025-06-01

**Context**: 
Need comprehensive monitoring and observability stack for distributed microservices architecture.

**Decision**: 
Comprehensive observability stack:
- **Metrics**: Prometheus for metrics collection and alerting
- **Visualization**: Grafana for dashboards and visualization
- **Logging**: ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) for log aggregation
- **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed tracing
- **APM**: New Relic for application performance monitoring
- **Alerting**: PagerDuty for incident management

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Single Vendor**: DataDog or New Relic for everything but vendor lock-in
2. **Cloud Native**: AWS CloudWatch but vendor lock-in and feature limitations
3. **Open Source Only**: Lower cost but operational overhead
4. **Minimal Stack**: Basic monitoring but insufficient for microservices

**Rationale**:
- **Comprehensive**: Complete observability across all layers
- **Open Standards**: Based on open source tools and standards
- **Scalability**: Proven scalability for large deployments
- **Community**: Large community and ecosystem
- **Flexibility**: Can replace components as needs evolve
- **Cost Balance**: Balance of cost and functionality

**Implications**:
- **Complexity**: Multiple tools to manage and maintain
- **Storage**: Significant storage requirements for logs and metrics
- **Expertise**: Need expertise in multiple monitoring tools
- **Integration**: Must integrate all tools for unified view

## 9. Data Architecture Decisions

### TD-022: Data Lake vs Data Warehouse Strategy
**Date**: 2024-12-01 | **Status**: Accepted | **Review Date**: 2025-12-01

**Context**: 
Need strategy for storing and processing large volumes of structured and unstructured data for analytics and machine learning.

**Decision**: 
Hybrid Data Lake and Data Warehouse architecture:
- **Data Lake**: Amazon S3 for raw data storage (all data types)
- **Data Warehouse**: Snowflake for processed, structured data
- **Data Processing**: Apache Spark for ETL and data processing
- **Stream Processing**: Apache Kafka + Spark Streaming for real-time data

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Data Warehouse Only**: Structured data only, limited flexibility
2. **Data Lake Only**: Flexible but query performance issues
3. **Cloud Native**: AWS Lake Formation but vendor lock-in

**Rationale**:
- **Flexibility**: Data lake supports all data types and future use cases
- **Performance**: Data warehouse optimized for analytical queries
- **Cost**: Data lake provides cost-effective storage for large volumes
- **Processing**: Spark provides powerful data processing capabilities
- **Real-time**: Stream processing enables real-time analytics
- **Scalability**: Both components scale independently

**Implications**:
- **Complexity**: More complex architecture with multiple storage systems
- **Data Movement**: Need efficient data movement between lake and warehouse
- **Governance**: Need strong data governance across both systems
- **Skills**: Team needs expertise in multiple data technologies

### TD-023: Master Data Management Strategy
**Date**: 2024-12-01 | **Status**: Accepted | **Review Date**: 2025-09-01

**Context**: 
Need master data management for customer, product, and location data consistency across multiple systems.

**Decision**: 
Service-based Master Data Management:
- **Customer MDM**: Dedicated customer service as system of record
- **Product MDM**: Product catalog service as authoritative source
- **Location MDM**: Store management service for location data
- **Synchronization**: Event-driven synchronization across systems

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Centralized MDM Platform**: Single MDM system but complex integration
2. **Database-level MDM**: Shared database but tight coupling
3. **No Formal MDM**: Each system owns its data but consistency issues

**Rationale**:
- **Service Ownership**: Clear ownership and responsibility for each domain
- **Loose Coupling**: Event-driven approach maintains service independence
- **Flexibility**: Each service can evolve its data model independently
- **Performance**: No single point of failure or bottleneck
- **Domain Alignment**: Aligns with domain-driven design principles

**Implications**:
- **Consistency**: Eventual consistency model requires careful design
- **Conflict Resolution**: Need strategies for handling data conflicts
- **Data Quality**: Need robust data quality monitoring and correction
- **Synchronization**: Complex event-driven synchronization logic

## 10. Machine Learning and AI Decisions

### TD-024: ML Platform Architecture
**Date**: 2024-12-01 | **Status**: Proposed | **Review Date**: 2025-06-01

**Context**: 
Need machine learning platform for demand forecasting, personalization, and predictive analytics starting in Phase 4.

**Decision**: 
Cloud-native ML platform using managed services:
- **ML Platform**: Amazon SageMaker for model development and deployment
- **Feature Store**: SageMaker Feature Store for feature management
- **Model Registry**: MLflow for model versioning and registry
- **Serving**: SageMaker endpoints for model serving
- **Monitoring**: Amazon CloudWatch + custom monitoring for model performance

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. **Custom ML Platform**: Full control but significant development effort
2. **Kubernetes-based**: Kubeflow for containerized ML but operational complexity
3. **Multi-cloud ML**: Multiple cloud ML services but integration complexity
4. **Open Source**: MLflow + Kubernetes but operational overhead

**Rationale**:
- **Managed Service**: Reduces operational overhead for ML infrastructure
- **Integration**: Good integration with existing AWS infrastructure
- **Scalability**: Proven scalability for enterprise ML workloads
- **Features**: Comprehensive ML lifecycle management
- **Team Productivity**: Allows data scientists to focus on models, not infrastructure
- **Cost**: Pay-per-use model aligns with ML development cycles

**Implications**:
- **Vendor Lock-in**: Significant dependency on AWS ML services
- **Skills**: Team needs SageMaker expertise
- **Cost**: Can be expensive for large-scale model serving
- **Migration**: Future migration to other platforms would be complex
