## Cross-System Workflow Dependencies

### High-Priority Integration Points
1. **POS ↔ Payment Service**: Real-time payment processing and transaction validation
2. **Customer App ↔ POS**: Order synchronization and status updates
3. **HR System ↔ POS**: Staff authentication and shift management
4. **CRM ↔ Loyalty Service**: Customer data and reward management
5. **Franchise Portal ↔ Financial Service**: Fee collection and reporting

### Data Flow Patterns
- **Real-time Synchronization**: Payment processing, inventory updates, order status
- **Batch Processing**: Daily settlements, payroll processing, reporting
- **Event-Driven Updates**: Loyalty point updates, promotional notifications, inventory alerts

## Workflow State Management

### Transaction States
- **Initiated**: Workflow starts but not yet processed
- **In Progress**: Workflow is being executed
- **Pending Approval**: Requires manual intervention or approval
- **Completed**: Workflow finished successfully
- **Failed**: Workflow encountered error and requires intervention
- **Cancelled**: Workflow terminated by user or system

### Persistence Requirements
- **Audit Trail**: All workflow steps must be logged for compliance
- **State Recovery**: System must recover workflow state after failures
- **Data Consistency**: Cross-system data must remain consistent during workflow execution

## Error Handling & Recovery

### Failure Scenarios
1. **System Unavailability**: Network outages, service downtime
2. **Data Inconsistency**: Cross-system data synchronization failures
3. **User Errors**: Invalid inputs, incomplete processes
4. **Timeout Conditions**: Long-running processes that exceed limits
5. **Authorization Failures**: Permission or authentication issues

### Recovery Strategies
- **Retry Mechanisms**: Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- **Compensation Transactions**: Rollback operations for failed workflows
- **Manual Intervention**: Queue for human review when automated recovery fails
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continue with reduced functionality during partial failures

## Workflow Performance Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Completion Rate**: Percentage of workflows completed successfully
- **Processing Time**: Average time from initiation to completion
- **Error Rate**: Percentage of workflows that encounter errors
- **User Satisfaction**: Customer/employee satisfaction with workflow experience
- **System Performance**: Response times and throughput metrics

### Monitoring Requirements
- Real-time workflow status monitoring
- Automated alerting for failures and performance degradation
- Business metrics tracking and reporting
- Compliance and audit trail monitoring

## Security & Compliance Considerations

### Data Protection
- PII data encryption in transit and at rest

## Localization Requirements

### Multi-Region Support
