    PaymentPending --> PaymentFailed: Payment declined
    PaymentPending --> Confirmed: Payment successful
    PaymentFailed --> InCart: Retry payment
    PaymentFailed --> Cancelled: Customer cancels
    Confirmed --> Kitchen: Sent to preparation
    Kitchen --> Preparing: Kitchen starts work
    Preparing --> Ready: Order completed
    Ready --> Collected: Customer pickup
    Ready --> Expired: Not collected (30 min)
    Collected --> [*]: Order complete
    Cancelled --> [*]: Order terminated
    Expired --> [*]: Order archived
    
    state PaymentPending {
        [*] --> Processing
        Processing --> Authorized

    Gateway->>Auth: Validate Token
    Auth->>Gateway: Token Valid
    Gateway->>Service: Forward Request
    Service->>DB: Query Data
    DB->>Service: Return Data
    Service->>Gateway: Response
    Gateway->>Client: Final Response
    
    Note over Client,DB: Synchronous flow for real-time operations
```

### 4.2 Event-Driven Asynchronous Communication

    Saga->>Payment: Process Payment
    Payment->>Saga: Payment Success
    
    Saga->>Inventory: Reserve Items
    Inventory->>Saga: Items Reserved
    
    Saga->>Kitchen: Queue Order
    Kitchen->>Saga: Order Queued
    
    Note over Saga,Kitchen: Success Path
    
    alt Payment Fails
        Payment->>Saga: Payment Failed
        Saga->>Order: Cancel Order
        Order->>Saga: Order Cancelled
    end
    
    alt Inventory Fails
        Inventory->>Saga: Reservation Failed
